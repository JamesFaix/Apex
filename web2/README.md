# Apex Web vNext

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run start` runs the app in development mode with a file watcher. Hosts at `localhost:3000`
- `npm run test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build` creates optimized production build
- `npm run eject` removes Create React App encapsulation

## Goals of vNext

- API client code generated with OpenAPI
- Mobile-first responsive UI
- Function-based JavaScript-style TypeScript code, not class-based C#-style
- Leverage Create React App as much as possible, minimal build customization
- Less state management bugs and page redirects
- Cleaner architecture, avoid spaghetti code of previous version
- Avoid Redux, use React contexts for state
- Better logging
